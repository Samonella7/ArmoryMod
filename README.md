For lack of a better way to describe this mod, here is the discription that's visible on the add-on server:
Sort through your units' weapons, re-distributing them freely! Arm your swordsman with a javelin, or capture an enemy's battle-axe so your dark adept can defend herself! A complete weapon inventory system that works with all default factions, and many add-on units as well. Works in both multiplayer and campaigns--just right-click a unit to get started!
